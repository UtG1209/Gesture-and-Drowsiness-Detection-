# Gesture-and-Drowsiness-Detection-

#Gesture 
The gestures 1 to 5 can be recognised using this model. It forms contours around the the gesture shown and the displays the output on the screen itself. Uses OpenCV and categorical_cross_entropy as well.

#Drowsiness
Uses the 68 face landmark predictor which superimposes 68 points on our face and then calculates the distance between them and tells whether the eyes are open or closed.
